WHO CAN SHOULDER THE IMMENSE, AWESOME RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE PRESIDENCY? WHO CAN PUT INTO ACTION THE PLANS THAT WILL MAKE YOUR LIFE BETTER? I HOPE THAT I WILL BE ABLE TO EARN YOUR VOTE ON NOVEMBER 8th. >> SECRETARY CLINTON, THANK YOU. MR. TRUMP, THE SAME QUESTION TO YOU. IT'S ABOUT PUTTING MONEY, MORE MONEY INTO THE POCKETS OF AMERICAN WORKERS. YOU HAVE UP TO TWO MINUTES. >> THANK YOU, LESTER. OUR JOBS ARE FLEEING THE COUNTRY. THEY'RE GOING TO MEXICO, THEY'RE GOING TO MANY OTHER COUNTRIES. YOU LOOK AT WHAT CHINA IS DOING TO OUR COUNTRY IN TERMS OF MAKING OUR PRODUCT. THEY'RE DEVALUING THEIR CURRENCY AND THERE'S NOBODY IN OUR GOVERNMENT TO FIGHT THEM AND WE HAVE A VERY GOOD FIGHT AND WE HAVE A WINNING FIGHT BECAUSE THEY'RE USING OUR COUNTRY AS A PIGGY BANK TO REBUILD CHINA AND MANY OTHER COUNTRIES ARE DOING THE SAME THING. SO WE'RE LOSING OUR GOOD JOBS. SO MANY OF THEM. WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN MEXICO, A FRIEND OF MINE WHO BUILDS PLANTS SAID IT'S THE EIGHTH WONDER OF THE WORLD, THEY'RE BUILDING SOME OF THE BIGGEST PLANTS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD, SOME OF THE MOST SOPHISTICATED, SOME OF THE BEST PLANTS. WITH THE UNITED STATES, AS YOU SAID, NOT SO MUCH. SO, FORD IS LEAVING, YOU SEE THAT. THEIR SMALL CARDI DIVISION LEAVING. THOUSANDS OF JOBS LEAVING MICHIGAN, LEAVING OHIO. THEY'RE ALL LEAVING. WE CAN'T ALLOW IT TO HAPPEN ANYMORE. AS FAR AS CHILDCARE IS CONCERNED AND SO MANY OTHER THINGS I THINK HILLARY AND I AGREE ON THAT. WE PROBABLY DISAGREE A LITTLE BIT AS TO NUMBERS AND AMOUNTS, AND WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO, BUT PERHAPS WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT THAT LATER. BUT WE HAVE TO STOP OUR JOBS FROM BEING STOLEN FROM US. WE HAVE TO STOP OUR COMPANIES FROM LEAVING THE UNITED STATES AND WITH IT, FIRING ALL OF THE PEOPLE. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS TAKE A LOOK AT CARRIER AIR-CONDITIONING IN INDIANAPOLIS. THEY FIRED 1,400 PEOPLE. THEY'RE GOING TO MEXICO. SO MANY HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF COMPANIES ARE DOING THIS. WE CANNOT LET IT HAPPEN. UNDER MY PLAN, I'LL BE REDUCING TAXES TREMENDOUSLY FROM 35% TO 15% FOR COMPANIES, SMALL AND BIG BUSINESSES. THAT'S GOING TO BE A JOB CREATOR LIKE WE HAVEN'T SEEN SINCE RONALD REAGAN. IT'S GOING TO BE A BEAUTIFUL THING TO WATCH. COMPANIES WILL COME. THEY WILL BUILD. THEY WILL EXPAND. NEW COMPANIES WILL START. AND I LOOK VERY, VERY MUCH FORWARD TO DOING IT. WE HAVE TO RENEGOTIATE OUR TRADE DEALS AND WE HAVE TO STOP THESE COUNTRIES FROM STEALING OUR COMPANIES AND OUR JOBS. >> SECRETARY CLINTON, WOULD YOU LIKE TO RESPOND? >> WELL, I THINK THAT TRADE IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE. OF COURSE, WE HAVE 5% OF THE WORLD'S POPULATION. WE HAVE TO TRADE WITH THE OTHER 95%. AND WE NEED TO HAVE SMART, FAIR TRADE DEALS. WE ALSO, THOUGH, NEED TO HAVE A TAX SYSTEM THAT REWARDS WORK AND NOT JUST FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS. AND THE KIND OF PLAN"

THE TRUMP INTERNATIONAL IS WAY UNDERBUDGET AND WAY AHEAD OF SCHEDULE AND WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO THAT FOR OUR COUNTRY. >> WE'RE WELL BEHIND SCHEDULE, SO I WANT TO MOVE TO OUR NEXT SEGMENT. WE MOVE INTO OUR NEXT SEGMENT TALKING ABOUT AMERICA'S DIRECTION. LET'S START BY TALKING ABOUT RACE. A SHARE OF AMERICANS WHO SAY RACE RELATIONS ARE BAD IN THIS COUNTRY IS THE HIGHEST IT'S BEEN IN DECADES. MUCH OF IT AMPLIFIED BY SHOOTINGS OF AFRICAN-AMERICANS BY POLICE. AS WE'VE SEEN RECENTLY IN CHARLOTTE AND TULSA. RACE HAS BEEN A BIG ISSUE IN THIS CAMPAIGN, AND ONE OF YOU IS GOING TO HAVE TO BRIDGE A VERY WIDE AND BITTER GAP. SO HOW DO YOU HEAL THE DIVIDE? SECRETARY CLINTON, YOU GET TWO MINT MINUUTE MINUTES ON THIS. >> WELL, YOU'RE RIGHT. RACE REMAINS A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE IN OUR COUNTRY. UNFORTUNATELY, RACE STILL DETERMINES TOO MUCH. OFTEN DETERMINES WHERE PEOPLE LIVE, DETERMINES WHAT KIND OF EDUCATION IN THEIR PUBLIC SCHOOLS THEY CAN GET, AND, YES, IT DETERMINES HOW THEY'RE TREATED IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. WE'VE JUST SEEN THOSE TWO TRAGIC EXAMPLES IN BOTH TULSA AND CHARLOTTE. AND WE'VE GOT TO DO SEVERAL THINGS AT THE SAME TIME. WE HAVE TO RESTORE TRUST BETWEEN COMMUNITIES AND THE POLICE. WE HAVE TO WORK TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR POLICE ARE USING THE BEST TRAINING, THE BEST TECHNIQUES, THAT THEY'RE WELL PREPARED TO USE FORCE ONLY WHEN NECESSARY. EVERYONE SHOULD BE RESPECTED BY THE LAW AND EVERYONE SHOULD RESPECT THE LAW. RIGHT NOW, THAT'S NOT THE CASE IN A LOT OF OUR NEIGHBORHOODS. SO I HAVE EVER SINCE THE FIRST DAY OF MY CAMPAIGN CALLED FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM. I'VE LAID OUT A PLATFORM THAT I THINK WOULD BEGIN TO REMEDY SOME OF THE PROBLEMS WE HAVE IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM, BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO RECOGNIZE IN ADDITION TO THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE WITH POLICING, THERE ARE SO MANY GOOD, BRAVE POLICE OFFICERS WHO EQUALLY WANT REFORM. SO WE HAVE TO BRING COMMUNITIES TOGETHER IN ORDER TO BEGIN WORKING ON THAT AS A MUTUAL GOAL. AND WE'VE GOT TO GET GUNS OUT OF THE HANDS OF PEOPLE WHO SHOULD NOT HAVE THEM. THE GUN EPIDEMIC IS THE LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH OF YOUNG AFRICAN-AMERICAN MEN. MORE THAN THE NEXT NINE CAUSES PUT TOGETHER. SO WE HAVE TO DO TWO THINGS AS I SAID. WE HAVE TO RESTORE TRUST. WE HAVE TO WORK WITH THE POLICE. WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THEY RESPECT THE COMMUNITIES AND THE COMMUNITIES RESPECT THEM. AND WE HAVE TO TACKLE THE PLAGUE OF GUN VIOLENCE WHICH IS A BIG CONTRIBUTOR TO A LOT OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE'RE SEEING TODAY. >> ALL RIGHT, MR. TRUMP, YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES. HOW DO YOU HEAL THE DIVIDE? >> FIRST OF ALL, SECRETARY CLINTON DOESN'T WANT TO USE A COUPLE OF WORDS AND THAT'S LAW AND ORDER. WE NEED LAW AND ORDER. IF WE DON'T HAVE IT, WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE A COUNTRY, AND WHEN I LOOK AT WHAT'S GOING ON IN CHARLOTTE, A CITY I LOVE, A CITY WHERE I HAVE INVESTMENTS, WHEN I LOOK AT WHAT'S GOING ON THROUGHOUT VARIOUS PARTS OF OUR COUNTRY, WHETHER IT'S -- I MEAN, I CAN JUST KEEP NAMING THEM ALL DAY LONG. WE NEED LAW AND ORDER IN OUR COUNTRY AND I JUST GOT TODAY THE, AS YOU KNOW, THE ENDORSEMENT OF THE FRATERNAL ORDER OF POLICE. JUST CAME IN. WE HAVE ENDORSEMENTS FROM, I THINK, ALMOST EVERY POLICE GROUP, VERY -- I MEAN, A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF THEM IN THE UNITED STATES. WE HAVE A SITUATION WHERE WE HAVE OUR INNER CITIES, AFRICAN-AMERICANS, HISPANICS, ARE LIVING IN HELL BECAUSE IT'S SO DANGEROUS. YOU WALK DOWN THE STREET, YOU GET SHOT. IN CHICAGO, THEY'VE HAD THOUSANDS OF SHOOTINGS, THOUSANDS SINCE JANUARY 1st. THOUSANDS OF SHOOTINGS. I SAY, WHERE IS THIS? IS THIS A WAR-TORN COUNTRY? WHAT ARE WE DOING? AND WE HAVE TO STOP THE VIOLENCE. WE HAVE TO BRING BACK LAW AND ORDER. IN A PLACE LIKE CHICAGO WHERE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED. THOUSANDS OVER THE LAST NUMBER OF YEARS. IN FACT, ALMOST 4,000 HAVE BEEN KILLED SINCE BARACK OBAMA BECAME PRESIDENT. OVER -- ALMOST 4,000 PEOPLE IN CHICAGO HAVE BEEN KILLED. WE HAVE TO BRING BACK LAW AND ORDER. NOW, WHETHER OR NOT IN A PLACE LIKE CHICAGO YOU DO STOP AND FRISK, WHICH WORKED VERY WELL, MAYOR GIULIANI IS HERE, IT WORKED VERY WELL IN NEW YORK. IT BROUGHT THE CRIME RATE WAY DOWN, BUT YOU TAKE THE GUN AWAY FROM CRIMINALS THAT SHOULDN'T BE HAVING IT. WE HAVE GANGS ROAMING THE STREET AND IN MANY CASES THEY'RE ILLEGALLY HERE. ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS. AND THEY HAVE GUNS. AND THEY SHOOT PEOPLE. AND WE HAVE TO BE VERY STRONG AND WE HAVE TO BE VERY VIGILANT. WE HAVE TO BE -- WE HAVE TO KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING. RIGHT NOW, OUR POLICE IN MANY CASES ARE AFRAID TO DO ANYTHING. WE HAVE TO PROTECT OUR INNER CITIES BECAUSE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITIES ARE BEING DECIMATED BY CRIME. >> YOUR TWO MINUTES HAS EXPIRED. I DO WANT TO FOLLOW-UP. STOP AND FRISK WAS RULED UNCONSTITUTIONAL IN NEW YORK BECAUSE IT LARGELY SINGLED OUT BLACK AND HISPANIC YOUNG MEN. >> NO, YOU'RE WRONG. IT WENT BEFORE A JUDGE WHO WAS A VERY AGAINST POLICE JUDGE. IT WAS TAKEN AWAY FROM HER AND OUR MAYOR, OUR NEW MAYOR, REFUSED TO GO FORWARD WITH THE CASE. THEY WOULD HAVE WANTED IT REPEALED. IF YOU LOOK AT IT THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY, THERE ARE MANY PLACES -- >> THE ARGUMENT IS IT'S A FORM OF RACIAL PROFILING. >> NO, THE ARGUMENT IS WE HAVE TO TAKE THE GUNS AWAY FROM THESE PEOPLE THAT HAVE THEM AND ARE BAD PEOPLE THAT SHOULDN'T HAVE THEM. THESE ARE FELONS. THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE BAD PEOPLE THAT SHOULDN'T BE -- WHEN YOU HAVE 3,000 SHOOTINGS IN CHICAGO FROM JANUARY 1st, WHEN YOU HAVE 4,000 PEOPLE KILLED IN CHICAGO BY GUNS FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE PRESIDENCY OF BARACK OBAMA, HIS HOMETOWN, YOU HAVE TO HAVE STOP AND FRISK. YOU NEED MORE POLICE. YOU NEED A BETTER COMMUNITY, YOU KNOW, RELATION. U Y YOU DON'T HAVE GOOD COMMUNITY RELATIONS IN KMAUG. IT CHICAGO. IT'S TERRIBLE. I HAVE PROPERTY THERE. IT'S TERRIBLE WHAT'S GOING ON IN CHICAGO. YOU GO TO FERGUSON, GO TO SO MANY DIFFERENT PLACES. YOU NEED BETTER RELATIONSHIPS. I AGREE WITH SECRETARY CLINTON ON THIS. YOU NEED BETTER RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE COMMUNITIES AND THE POLICE BECAUSE IN SOME CASES IT'S NOT GOOD. BUT YOU LOOK AT DALLAS, WHERE THE RELATIONSHIPS WERE REALLY STUDIED. THE RELATIONSHIPS WERE REALLY A BEAUTIFUL THING. AND THEN FIVE POLICE OFFICERS WERE KILLED. ONE NIGHT, VERY VIOLENTLY. SO THERE'S SOME BAD THINGS GOING ON. SOME REALLY BAD THINGS. >> SECRETARY CLINTON -- >> BUT WE NEED -- LESTER, WE NEED LAW AND ORDER AND WE NEED LAW AND ORDER IN THE INNER CITIES BECAUSE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE MOST AFFECTED BY WHAT'S HAPPENING ARE AFRICAN-AMERICAN AND HISPANIC PEOPLE. AND IT'S VERY UNFAIR TO THEM WHAT OUR POLITICIANS ARE ALLOWING TO HAPPEN. >> SECRETARY CLINTON. >> WELL, I'VE HEARD -- I'VE HEARD DONALD SAY THIS AT HIS RALLIES AND IT'S REALLY UNFORTUNATE THAT HE PAINTS SUCH A DIRE NEGATIVE PICTURE OF BLACK COMMUNITIES IN OUR COUNTRY. THE VIBRANCY OF THE BLACK CHURCH, THE BLACK BUSINESSES THAT EMPLOY SO MANY PEOPLE. THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT SO MANY FAMILIES ARE WORKING TO PROVIDE FOR THEIR KIDS. THERE'S A LOT THAT WE SHOULD BE PROUD OF AND WE SHOULD BE SUPPORTING AND LIFTING UP, BUT WE DO ALWAYS HAVE TO MAKE SURE WE KEEP PEOPLE SAFE. THERE ARE THE RIGHT WAYS OF DOING IT AND THEN THERE ARE WAYS THAT ARE INEFFECTIVE. STOP AND FRISK WAS FOUND TO BE UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND IN PART BECAUSE IT WAS INEFFECTIVE. IT DID NOT DO WHAT IT NEEDED TO DO. NOW, I BELIEVE IN COMMUNITY POLICING AND, IN FACT, VIOLENT CRIME IS ONE-HALF OF WHAT IT WAS IN 1991. PROPERTY CRIME IS DOWN WE DON'T WANT TO SEE IT CREEP BACK UP. WE'VE HAD 25 YEARS OF VERY GOOD COOPERATION, BUT THERE WERE SOME PROBLEM, SOME UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. TOO MANY YOUNG AFRICAN-AMERICAN AND LATINO MEN ENDED UP IN JAIL FOR NONVIOLENT OFFENSES AND IT'S JUST A FACT THAT IF YOU'RE A YOUNG AFRICAN-AMERICAN MAN AND YOU DO THE SAME THING AS A YOUNG WHITE MAN, YOU ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE ARRESTED, CHARGED, CONVICTED AND INCARCERATED. SO WE'VE GOT TO ADDRESS THE SYSTEMIC RACISM IN OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. WE CANNOT JUST SAY LAW AND ORDER. WE HAVE TO SAY WE -- WE HAVE TO COME FORWARD WITH A PLAN THAT IS GOING TO DIVERT PEOPLE FROM THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM, DEAL WITH MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCES WHICH HAVE PUT TOO MANY PEOPLE AWAY FOR TOO LONG FOR DOING TOO LITTLE. WE NEED TO HAVE MORE SECOND-CHANCE PROGRAMS. I'M GLAD THAT WE'RE ENDING PRIVATE PRISONS IN THE FEDERAL SYSTEM. I WANT TO SEE THEM ENDED IN THE STATE SYSTEM. YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE A PROFIT MOTIVATION TO FILL PRISON CELLS WITH YOUNG AMERICANS. SO THERE ARE SOME POSITIVE WAYS WE CAN WORK ON THIS, AND I BELIEVE STRONGLY THAT COMMON SENSE GUN SAFETY MEASURES WOULD ASSIST US. RIGHT NOW, AND THIS IS SOMETHING DONALD HAS SUPPORTED ALONG WITH THE GUN LOBBY, RIGHT NOW WE'VE GOT TOO MANY MILITARY-STYLE WEAPONS ON THE STREETS AND A LOT OF PLACES OUR POLICE ARE OUT-GUNNED. WE NEED COMPREHENSIVE BACKGROUND CHECKS AND WE NEED TO KEEP GUNS OUT OF THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO WILL DO HARM AND WE FINALLY NEED TO PASS A PROHIBITION ON ANYONE WHO'S ON THE TERRORIST WATCHLIST FROM BEING ABLE TO BUY A GUN IN OUR COUNTRY. IF YOU'RE TOO DANGEROUS TO FLY, YOU ARE TOO DANGEROUS TO BUY A GUN. SO THERE ARE THINGS WE CAN DO AND WE OUGHT TO DO IT IN A BIPARTISAN WAY. >> SECRETARY CLINTON, LAST WEEK YOU SAID WE'VE GOT DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO IMPROVE POLICING TO GO RIGHT AT IMPLICIT BIAS.

MANY OF WHICH, AS YOU KNOW, ARE MUSLIM MAJORITY NATIONS. DONALD HAS CONSISTENTLY INSULTED MUSLIMS ABROAD. MUSLIMS AT HOME. WHEN WE NEED TO BE COOPERATING WITH MUSLIM NATIONS AND WITH THE AMERICAN MUSLIM COMMUNITY. THEY'RE ON THE FRONT LINES. THEY CAN PROVIDE INFORMATION TO US THAT WE MIGHT NOT GET ANYWHERE ELSE. THEY NEED TO HAVE CLOSE WORKING COOPERATION WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THESE COMMUNITIES. NOT BE ALIENATED AND PUSHED AWAY AS SOME OF DONALD'S RHETORIC, UNFORTUNATELY, HAS LED TO. >> MR. -- >> WELL, I HAVE TO RESPOND. >> PLEASE RESPOND. >> THE SECRETARY SAID, VERY STRONGLY, ABOUT WORKING WITH -- WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THEM FOR MANY YEARS AND WE HAVE THE GREATEST MESS ANYONE'S EVER SEEN. YOU LOOK AT THE MIDDLE EAST. IT'S A TOTAL MESS. UNDER YOUR DIRECTION TO A LARGE EXTENT, BUT YOU LOOK AT THE MIDDLE EAST. YOU STARTED THE IRAN DEAL. THAT'S ANOTHER BEAUTY WHERE YOU HAVE A COUNTRY THAT WAS READY TO FALL, I MEAN, IT WAS DOING SO BADLY, THEY WERE CHOKING ON THE SANCTIONS AND NOW THEY'RE GOING TO BE ACTUALLY PROBABLY A MAJOR POWER AT SOME POINT PRETTY SOON THE WAY THEY'RE GOING. BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT NATO, I WAS ASKED ON A MAJOR SHOW, WHAT DO YOU THINK OF NATO? YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND, I'M A BUSINESSPERSON. I DID REALLY WELL, BUT I HAVE COMMON SENSE. AND I SAID, WELL, I'LL TELL YOU, I HAVEN'T GIVEN LOTS OF THOUGHT TO NATO, BUT TWO THINGS. NUMBER ONE, THE 28 COUNTRIES OF NATO, MANY OF THEM AREN'T PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE. NUMBER TWO, AND THAT BOTHERS ME BECAUSE WE SHOULD BE -- WE'RE DEFENDING THEM. THEY SHOULD AT LEAST BE PAYING US WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE PAYING BY TREATY AND CONTRACT. AND NUMBER TWO, I SAID, AND VERY STRONGLY, NATO COULD BE OBSOLETE BECAUSE -- AND I WAS VERY STRONG ON THIS. IT WAS ACTUALLY COVERED VERY ACCURATELY IN ""THE NEW YORK TIMES"" WHICH IS UNUSUAL FOR ""THE NEW YORK TIMES"" TO BE HONEST. BUT I SAID, THEY DO NOT FOCUS ON TERROR. AND I WAS VERY STRONG. AND I SAID IT NUMEROUS TIMES AND ABOUT FOUR MONTHS AGO, I READ ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE ""WALL STREET JOURNAL"" THAT NATO IS OPENING UP A MAJOR TERROR DIVISION AND I THINK THAT'S GREAT. AND I THINK WE SHOULD GET, BECAUSE WE PAY APPROXIMATELY 73% OF THE COST OF NATO, IT'S A LOT OF MONEY TO PROTECT OTHER PEOPLE. BUT I'M ALL FOR NATO, BUT I SAID THEY HAVE TO FOCUS ON TERROR ALSO. AND THEY'RE GOING TO DO THAT. AND THAT WAS, BELIEVE ME, I'M NOT GOING TO GET CREDIT FOR IT BUT THAT WAS LARGELY BECAUSE OF WHAT I WAS SAYING AND MY CRITICISM OF NATO. I THINK WE HAVE TO GET NATO TO GO INTO THE MIDDLE EAST WITH US IN ADDITION TO SURROU SURROUNDING NATIONS AND WE HAVE TO KNOCK THE HELL OUT OF ISIS AND WE HAVE TO DO IT FAST. WHEN ISIS FORMED IN THIS VACUUM CREATED BY BARACK OBAMA AND SECRETARY CLINTON, AND BELIEVE ME, YOU WERE THE ONES THAT TOOK OUT THE TROOPS. NOT ONLY THAT, YOU NAMED THE DAY. THEY COULDN'T BELIEVE IT. THEY SAT BACK PROBABLY AND SAID -- >> LESTER, WE COVERED THIS -- >> WAIT A MINUTE. THEY SAID WAIT A MINUTE, WHEN THEY FORMED, THIS IS SOMETHING THAT NEVER SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED. IT NEVER SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED. NOW YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT TAKING OUT ISIS. BUT YOU WERE THERE AND YOU WERE SECRETARY OF STATE WHEN IT WAS A LITTLE INFANT. NOW IT'S IN OVER 30 COUNTRIES AND YOU'RE GOING TO STOP THEM? I DON'T THINK SO. >> MR. TRUMP, WITH A LOT OF THESE ARE JUDGMENT QUESTIONS. YOU HAD SUPPORTED THE WAR IN IRAQ BEFORE THE INVASION. WHAT MAKES YOUR -- >> I DID NOT SUPPORT THE WAR IN IRAQ. >> 2002 -- >> THAT IS A MAINSTREAM MEDIA NONSENSE PUT OUT BY HER BECAUSE SHE FRANKLY I THINK THE BEST PERSON IN HER CAMPAIGN IS MAINSTREAM MEDIA. >> MY QUESTION -- >> WOULD YOU LIKE TO HEAR? I WAS AGAINST -- WAIT A MINUTE. I WAS AGAINST THE WAR IN IRAQ. JUST SO YOU PUT IT OUT. >> THE RECORD SHOWS OTHERWISE. WHY -- >> THE RECORD DOES NOT SHOW -- >> WHY IS YOUR JUDGMENT ANY -- >> THE RECORD SHOWS THAT I'M RIGHT. WHEN I DID AN INTERVIEW WITH HOWARD STERN, VERY LIKELY FIRST TIME ANYONE'S ASKED ME THAT, I SAID, VERY LIKEL LI ASKED ME THAT, I SAID, VERY LIKEL GHTLY, I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE, WHO KNOWS, ESSENTIALLY. I THEN DID AN INTERVIEW WITH NEIL CAVUTO, TALKED ABOUT THE ECONOMY IS MORE IMPORTANT. I SPOKE TO SEAN HANNITY, EVERYBODY REFUSES TO CALL SEAN HANNITY. I HAD NUMEROUS CONVERSATIONS WITH SEAN HANNITY AT FOX AND SEAN HANNITY SAID, AND HE CALLED ME THE OTHER DAY, AND I SPOKE TO HIM ABOUT IT. HE SAID, YOU WERE TOTALLY AGAINST THE WAR. HE WAS FOR THE WAR. >> WHY IS YOUR JUDGMENT BETTER -- >> THAT WAS BEFORE THE WAR STARTED. SEAN HANNITY SAID, VERY STRONGLY, TO ME AND OTHER PEOPLE, HE'S WILLING TO SAY, BUT NOBODY WANTS TO CALL HIM. I WAS AGAINST THE WAR. HE SAID, YOU USED TO HAVE FIGHTS WITH ME BECAUSE SEAN WAS IN FAVOR OF THE WAR. I UNDERSTAND THAT SIDE ALSO. NOT VERY MUCH, BECAUSE WE SHOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN THERE. BUT NOBODY CALLS SEAN HANNITY. THEN THEY DID AN ARTICLE IN A MAJOR MAGAZINE SHORTLY AFTER THE WAR STARTED I THINK IN '04, BUT THEY DID AN ARTICLE WHICH HAD ME TOTALLY AGAINST THE WAR IN IRAQ. AND ONE OF YOUR COMPATRIOTS SAID, YOU KNOW, WHETHER IT WAS BEFORE OR RIGHT AFTER, TRUMP WAS DEFINITE BECAUSE IF YOU READ THIS ARTICLE, THERE'S NO DOUBT. BUT IF SOMEBODY, AND I'LL ASK THE PRESS, IF SOMEBODY WOULD CALL UP SEAN HANNITY, THIS WAS BEFORE THE WAR STARTED, HE AND I USED TO HAVE ARGUMENTS ABOUT THE WAR. I SAID IT'S A TERRIBLE AND A STUPID THING. IT'S GOING TO DESTABILIZE THE MIDDLE EAST AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT'S DONE. >> MY REFERENCE WAS WHAT YOU HAD SAID IN MY QUESTION WAS -- >> YOU DIDN'T HEAR WHAT I SAID. >> WHY IS YOUR JUDGMENT ANY DIFFERENT THAN MRS. CLINTON'S? >> I HAVE MUCH BETTER JUDGMENT THAN SHE DOES. THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT. I ALSO HAVE A MUCH BETTER TEMPERAMENT THAN SHE HAS. YOU KNOW? I HAVE A MUCH BETTER -- SHE SPENT, LET ME TELL YOU, SHE SPENT HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON AN ADVERTISING -- YOU KNOW, THEY GET MADISON AVENUE INTO A ROOM, THEY PUT NAMES -- OH, TEMPERAMENT, LET'S GO AFTER IT.
