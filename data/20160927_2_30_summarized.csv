THE TRUMP INTERNATIONAL IS WAY UNDERBUDGET AND WAY AHEAD OF SCHEDULE AND WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO THAT FOR OUR COUNTRY. >> WE'RE WELL BEHIND SCHEDULE, SO I WANT TO MOVE TO OUR NEXT SEGMENT. WE MOVE INTO OUR NEXT SEGMENT TALKING ABOUT AMERICA'S DIRECTION. LET'S START BY TALKING ABOUT RACE. A SHARE OF AMERICANS WHO SAY RACE RELATIONS ARE BAD IN THIS COUNTRY IS THE HIGHEST IT'S BEEN IN DECADES. MUCH OF IT AMPLIFIED BY SHOOTINGS OF AFRICAN-AMERICANS BY POLICE. AS WE'VE SEEN RECENTLY IN CHARLOTTE AND TULSA. RACE HAS BEEN A BIG ISSUE IN THIS CAMPAIGN, AND ONE OF YOU IS GOING TO HAVE TO BRIDGE A VERY WIDE AND BITTER GAP. SO HOW DO YOU HEAL THE DIVIDE? SECRETARY CLINTON, YOU GET TWO MINT MINUUTE MINUTES ON THIS. >> WELL, YOU'RE RIGHT. RACE REMAINS A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE IN OUR COUNTRY. UNFORTUNATELY, RACE STILL DETERMINES TOO MUCH. OFTEN DETERMINES WHERE PEOPLE LIVE, DETERMINES WHAT KIND OF EDUCATION IN THEIR PUBLIC SCHOOLS THEY CAN GET, AND, YES, IT DETERMINES HOW THEY'RE TREATED IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. WE'VE JUST SEEN THOSE TWO TRAGIC EXAMPLES IN BOTH TULSA AND CHARLOTTE. AND WE'VE GOT TO DO SEVERAL THINGS AT THE SAME TIME. WE HAVE TO RESTORE TRUST BETWEEN COMMUNITIES AND THE POLICE. WE HAVE TO WORK TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR POLICE ARE USING THE BEST TRAINING, THE BEST TECHNIQUES, THAT THEY'RE WELL PREPARED TO USE FORCE ONLY WHEN NECESSARY. EVERYONE SHOULD BE RESPECTED BY THE LAW AND EVERYONE SHOULD RESPECT THE LAW. RIGHT NOW, THAT'S NOT THE CASE IN A LOT OF OUR NEIGHBORHOODS. SO I HAVE EVER SINCE THE FIRST DAY OF MY CAMPAIGN CALLED FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM. I'VE LAID OUT A PLATFORM THAT I THINK WOULD BEGIN TO REMEDY SOME OF THE PROBLEMS WE HAVE IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM, BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO RECOGNIZE IN ADDITION TO THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE WITH POLICING, THERE ARE SO MANY GOOD, BRAVE POLICE OFFICERS WHO EQUALLY WANT REFORM. SO WE HAVE TO BRING COMMUNITIES TOGETHER IN ORDER TO BEGIN WORKING ON THAT AS A MUTUAL GOAL. AND WE'VE GOT TO GET GUNS OUT OF THE HANDS OF PEOPLE WHO SHOULD NOT HAVE THEM. THE GUN EPIDEMIC IS THE LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH OF YOUNG AFRICAN-AMERICAN MEN. MORE THAN THE NEXT NINE CAUSES PUT TOGETHER. SO WE HAVE TO DO TWO THINGS AS I SAID. WE HAVE TO RESTORE TRUST. WE HAVE TO WORK WITH THE POLICE. WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THEY RESPECT THE COMMUNITIES AND THE COMMUNITIES RESPECT THEM. AND WE HAVE TO TACKLE THE PLAGUE OF GUN VIOLENCE WHICH IS A BIG CONTRIBUTOR TO A LOT OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE'RE SEEING TODAY. >> ALL RIGHT, MR. TRUMP, YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES. HOW DO YOU HEAL THE DIVIDE? >> FIRST OF ALL, SECRETARY CLINTON DOESN'T WANT TO USE A COUPLE OF WORDS AND THAT'S LAW AND ORDER."
