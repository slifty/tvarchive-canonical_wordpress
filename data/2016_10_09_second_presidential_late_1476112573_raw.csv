BECAUSE I'VE HEARD FROM LOTS OF TEACHERS AND PARENTS ABOUT SOME OF THEIR CONCERNS ABOUT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT ARE BEING SAID AND DONE IN THIS CAMPAIGN. AND I THINK IT IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR US TO MAKE CLEAR TO OUR CHILDREN THAT OUR COUNTRY REALLY IS GREAT BECAUSE WE'RE GOOD. AND WE ARE GOING TO RESPECT ONE ANOTHER, LIFT EACH OTHER UP. WE ARE GOING TO BE LOOKING FOR WAYS TO CELEBRATE OUR DIVERSITY. AND WE ARE GOING TO TRY TO REACH OUT TO EVERY BOY AND GIRL AS WELL AS EVERY ADULT TO BRING THEM IN TO WORKING ON BEHALF OF OUR COUNTRY. I HAVE A VERY POSITIVE AND OPTIMISTIC VIEW ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO TOGETHER. THAT'S WHY THE SLOGAN OF MY CAMPAIGN IS STRONGER TOGETHER. BECAUSE I THINK IF WE WORK TOGETHER, IF WE OVERCOME THE DIVISIVENESS THAT SOMETIMES SETS AMERICANS AGAINST ONE ANOTHER AND INSTEAD WE MAKE SOME BIG GOALS AND I'VE SET FORTH SOME BIG GOALS GETTING THE ECONOMY TO WORK FOR EVERYONE, NOT JUST THOSE AT THE TOP. MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE THE BEST EDUCATION SYSTEM FROM PRESCHOOL THROUGH COLLEGE AND MAKING IT AFFORDABLE, AND SO MUCH ELSE. IF WE SET THOSE GOALS AND WE GO TOGETHER TO TRY TO ACHIEVE THEM, THERE'S NOTHING IN MY OPINION THAT AMERICA CAN'T DO. SO THAT'S WHY I HOPE THAT WE WILL COME TOGETHER IN THIS CAMPAIGN, OBVIOUSLY I'M HOPING TO EARN YOUR VOTE. I'M HOPING TO BE ELECTED IN NOVEMBER AND I CAN PROMISE YOU, I WILL WORK WITH EVERY AMERICAN, I WANT TO BE THE PRESIDENT FOR"

I AGREE WITH EVERYTHING SHE SAID. I BEGAN THIS CAMPAIGN BECAUSE I WAS SO TIRED OF SEEING SUCH FOOLISH THINGS HAPPEN TO OUR COUNTRY. THIS IS A GREAT COUNTRY. THIS IS A GREAT LAND. I HAVE GOTTEN TO KNOW THE PEOPLE OF THE COUNTRY OVER THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF THAT I'VE BEEN DOING THIS AS A POLITICIAN. I CANNOT BELIEVE I'M SAYING THAT ABOUT MYSELF BUT I GUESS I HAVE BEEN A POLITICIAN. AND MY WHOLE CONCEPT WAS TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. WHEN I WATCH THE DEALS BEING MADE, WHEN I WATCH WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH SOME HORRIBLE THINGS LIKE OBAMACARE WHERE YOUR HEALTH INSURANCE AND HEALTHCARE IS GOING UP BY NUMBERS THAT ARE ASTRONOMICAL, 68%, 59%, 71% WHEN I LOOK AT THE IRAN DEAL HOW BAD A DEAL IT IS FOR US, IT'S A ONE-SIDED TRANSACTION WHERE WE'RE GIVING BACK $150 BILLION TO A TERRORIST STATE, REALLY THE NUMBER ONE TERRORIST STATE. WE'VE MADE THEM AING TO COUNTRY FROM A WEAK COUNTRY JUST THREE YEARS AGO. WHEN I LOOK AT ALL OF THE THINGE POTENTIAL THAT OUR COUNTRY HAS, WE HAVE SUCH TREMENDOUS POTENTIAL, WHETHER IT'S IN BUSINESS AND TRADE WHERE WE'RE DOING SO BADLY. LAST YEAR WE HAD AN ALMOST $800 BILLION TRADE DEFICIT. IN OTHER WORDS, TRADING WITH OTHER COUNTRIES. WE HAD $800 BILLION DEFICIT. IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE. INCONCEIVABLE. YOU SAY WHO IS MAKING THESE DEALS? WE'RE GOING TO MAKE GRADE DEALS. HAVE A STRONG BORDER. BRING BACK LAW AND ORDER. JUST TODAY A POLICEMEN WERE SHOT, TWO KILLED, THIS IS HAPPENING ON A WEEKLY BASIS."

SO, YOU CAN SAY, ANY WAY YOU WANT TO SAY IT BUT BILL CLINTON WAS ABUSIVE TO WOMEN. HILLARY CLINTON ATTACKED THOSE SHAME WOMEN. ATTACKED THEM VICIOUSLY. FOUR OF THEM ARE HERE TONIGHT.

AND I TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR USING A PERSONAL E-MAIL ACCOUNT. OBVIOUSLY IF I WERE TO DO IT OVER AGAIN I WOULD NOT. I'M NOT MAKING ANY EXCUSES. IT WAS A MISTAKE. I AM VERY SORRY ABOUT THAT. BUT I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT WHERE THERE ARE SOME MISLEADING ACCUSATIONS FROM CRITICS AND OTHERS. AFTER A YEAR-LONG INVESTIGATION THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT ANYONE HACKED THE SERVER I WAS USING. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT ANY ONE CAN POINTED TO, AT ALL, ANYONE WHO SAYS OTHERWISE HAS NO BASIS, THAT ANY CLASSIFIED MATERIAL ENDED UP IN THE WRONG HANDS. I TAKE CLASSIFIED MATERIAL VERY SERIOUSLY. AND ALWAYS HAVE WHEN I WAS ON THE SENATE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE, I WAS PRIVY TO A LOT OF CLASSIFIED MATERIAL. OBVIOUSLY AS SECRETARY OF STATE, I HAD SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT SECRETS THAT WE POSSESS, SUCH AS GOING AFTER BIN LADEN.

SHE SAID THAT 33,000 E-MAILS HAD TO DO WITH HER DAUGHTER'S WEDDING, NUMBER ONE. AND A YOGA CLASS. WELL MAYBE WE'LL GIVE THREE OR FOUR OR FIVE -- 33,000 E-MAILS DELETED. NOW SHE'S SAYING THERE WASN'T ANYTHING WRONG. MORE IMPORTANTLY THAT WAS AFTER GETTING A SUBPOENA. THAT WASN'T BEFORE. THAT WAS AFTER SHE -- SHE GOT IT FROM THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS I'LL BE HONEST I AM SO DISAPPOINTED IN CONGRESSMAN, INCLUDING REPUBLICANS FOR ALLOWING THIS TO HAPPEN. OUR JUSTICE DEPARTMENT WHERE HER HUSBAND GOES ON TO THE BACK OF AIRPLANE FOR 39 MINUTES, TALKS TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL, DAYS BEFORE RULING IS GOING TO BE MADE ON HER CASE.

SO, I WANT VERY MUCH TO SAVE WHAT WORKS AND IS GOOD ABOUT THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. BUT WE'VE GOT TO GET COSTS DOWN. WE'VE GOT TO PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL HELP TO SMALL BUSINESSES SO THAT THEY CAN AFFORD TO PROVIDE HEALTH INSURANCE. BUT IF WE REPEAL IT AS DONALD HAS PROPOSED, AND START OVER AGAIN, ALL OF THOSE BENEFITS I JUST MENTIONED ARE LOST TO EVERYBODY. NOT JUST PEOPLE WHO GET THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE ON THE EXCHANGE.

WE WANT COMPETITION. YOU WILL HAVE FINEST HEALTH CARE PLAN. SHE WANTS TO GO TO SINGLE PAYER PLAN WHICH WOULD BE DISASTER. SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TO CANADA.

SO, IF WE JUST RIP IT UP AND THROW IT AWAY, WHAT DONALD NOT TELLING YOU, WE JUST TURN IT BACK TO THE INSURANCE COMPANIES THE WAY IT USED TO BE.
