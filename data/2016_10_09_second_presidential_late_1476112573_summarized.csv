BECAUSE I'VE HEARD FROM LOTS OF TEACHERS AND PARENTS ABOUT SOME OF THEIR CONCERNS ABOUT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT ARE BEING SAID AND DONE IN THIS CAMPAIGN. AND I THINK IT IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR US TO MAKE CLEAR TO OUR CHILDREN THAT OUR COUNTRY REALLY IS GREAT BECAUSE WE'RE GOOD. AND WE ARE GOING TO RESPECT ONE ANOTHER, LIFT EACH OTHER UP. WE ARE GOING TO BE LOOKING FOR WAYS TO CELEBRATE OUR DIVERSITY. AND WE ARE GOING TO TRY TO REACH OUT TO EVERY BOY AND GIRL AS WELL AS EVERY ADULT TO BRING THEM IN TO WORKING ON BEHALF OF OUR COUNTRY. I HAVE A VERY POSITIVE AND OPTIMISTIC VIEW ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO TOGETHER. THAT'S WHY THE SLOGAN OF MY CAMPAIGN IS STRONGER TOGETHER. BECAUSE I THINK IF WE WORK TOGETHER, IF WE OVERCOME THE DIVISIVENESS THAT SOMETIMES SETS AMERICANS AGAINST ONE ANOTHER AND INSTEAD WE MAKE SOME BIG GOALS AND I'VE SET FORTH SOME BIG GOALS GETTING THE ECONOMY TO WORK FOR EVERYONE, NOT JUST THOSE AT THE TOP. MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE THE BEST EDUCATION SYSTEM FROM PRESCHOOL THROUGH COLLEGE AND MAKING IT AFFORDABLE, AND SO MUCH ELSE. IF WE SET THOSE GOALS AND WE GO TOGETHER TO TRY TO ACHIEVE THEM, THERE'S NOTHING IN MY OPINION THAT AMERICA CAN'T DO. SO THAT'S WHY I HOPE THAT WE WILL COME TOGETHER IN THIS CAMPAIGN, OBVIOUSLY I'M HOPING TO EARN YOUR VOTE. I'M HOPING TO BE ELECTED IN NOVEMBER AND I CAN PROMISE YOU, I WILL WORK WITH EVERY AMERICAN, I WANT TO BE THE PRESIDENT FOR ALL AMERICANS."

SO, I WANT VERY MUCH TO SAVE WHAT WORKS AND IS GOOD ABOUT THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. BUT WE'VE GOT TO GET COSTS DOWN. WE'VE GOT TO PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL HELP TO SMALL BUSINESSES SO THAT THEY CAN AFFORD TO PROVIDE HEALTH INSURANCE. BUT IF WE REPEAL IT AS DONALD HAS PROPOSED, AND START OVER AGAIN, ALL OF THOSE BENEFITS I JUST MENTIONED ARE LOST TO EVERYBODY. NOT JUST PEOPLE WHO GET THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE ON THE EXCHANGE.
