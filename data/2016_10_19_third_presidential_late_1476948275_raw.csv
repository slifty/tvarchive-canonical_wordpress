SIX ROUGHLY 15-MINUTE SEGMENTS WITH TWO-MINUTE ANSWERS THEN OPEN DISCUSSION FOR THE REST OF EACH SEGMENT. BOTH CAMPAIGNS HAVE AGREED TO THOSE RULES.

WHAT KIND OF OPPORTUNITIES WILL WE PROVIDE FOR OUR CITIZENS, WHAT KIND OF RIGHTS WILL AMERICANS HAVE.

SO MANY STATES ARE PUTTING VERY STRINGENT REGULATIONS ON WOMEN, BUT BLOCK THEM FROM EXERCISING THAT CHOICE, TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY ARE DEFUNDING PLANNED PARENTHOOD, WHICH OF COURSE PROVIDES ALL KINDS OF CANCER SCREENINGS AND OTHER BENEFITS FOR WOMEN IN OUR COUNTRY. DONALD HALLS SAID HE'S IN FAVOR OF DEFUNDING PLANNED PARENTHOOD EVEN SUPPORTED SHUTTING THE GOVERNMENT DOWN TO DEFUND PLANNED PARENTHOOD. I WILL DEFEND PLANNED PARENTHOOD. DEFEND WOMEN'S RIGHTS TO MAKE THEIR OWN HEALTHCARE DECISIONS. WE HAVE COME TOO FAR TO HAVE THAT TURNED BACK NOW. INDEED HE SAID WOMEN SHOULD BE PUNISHED, THAT THERE SHOULD BE SOME FORM OF PUNISHMENT FOR WOMEN WHO OBTAIN ADORESS I COULD JUST NOT BE MORE OPPOSED. >> I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU CHANCE TO RESPOND I WANT TO ASK YOU SECRETARY CLINTON EXPLORE HOW FAR YOU BELIEVE THE RIGHT TO ABORTION GOES. YOU HAVE BEEN QUOTED AS SAYING, THAT THE PEOPLE HAVE NO CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS, YOU ALSO QUOTED AGAINST A BAN ON LATE-TERM PARTIAL BIRTH ABORTIONS. WHY? >> BECAUSE, ROE V.

IS THAT YOUR DREAM, OPEN BORDERS? >> WELL, IF YOU WENT TON READ THE REST OF THE SENTENCE I WAS TALKING ABOUT ENERGY. WE TRADE MORE ENERGY WITH OUR NEIGHBORS THAN WE TRADE WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD COMBINED. I DO WANT US TO HAVE AN ELECTRIC GRID, AN ENERGY SYSTEM THAT CROSSES BORDERS, I THINK THAT WILL BE GREAT BENEFIT TO US. QUOTING FROM WIKILEAKS WHAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT ABOUT WIKILEAKSS IS THAT THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT HAS ENGAGED IN ESPIONAGE AGAINST AMERICANS. THEY HAVE HACKED AMERICAN WEBSITES, AMERICAN ACCOUNTS OF PRIVATE PEOPLE, OF INSTITUTIONS. THEN THEY HAVE GIVEN THAT INFORMATION  WIKILEAKS FOR THE PURPOSE MUCH PUTTING IT ON THE INTERNET. THIS HAS COME FROM THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT. CLEARLY FROM POUT IN HIMSELF, IN AN EFFORT AS 17 OF OUR INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES HAVE CONFIRMED TO INFLUENCE OUR ELECTION. I ACTUALLY THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION OF THIS EVENING, CHRIS, IS FINALLY WILL DONALD TRUMP ADMIT AND CONDEMN THAT THE RUSSIANS ARE DOING THIS. AND MAKE IT CLEAR THAT HE WILL NOT HAVE THE HELP OF PUTIN IN THIS ELECTION, THAT HE REJ AMERICANS, WHICH HE ACTUALLY ENCOURAGED IN THE PAST. THOSE ARE THE QUESTIONS WE NEED"
