I'M CHRIS WALLACE OF FOX NEWS. I WELCOME YOU TO THE THIRD AND FINAL OF THE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES BETWEEN IS SECRETARY OF J. TRUMP. THIS DEBATE SPONSORED BY THE COMMISSION ON PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES, THE COMMISSION HAS DESIGNED THE FORMAT. SIX ROUGHLY 15-MINUTE SEGMENTS WITH TWO-MINUTE ANSWERS THEN OPEN DISCUSSION FOR THE REST OF EACH SEGMENT. BOTH CAMPAIGNS HAVE AGREED TO THOSE RULES. FOR THE RECORD, I DECIDED THE TOPICS AND THE QUESTIONS IN EACH TOPIC, NONE OF THOSE QUESTIONS HAS BEEN SHARED WITH THE COMMISSION OR THE TWO CANDIDATES. THE AUDIENCE HERE IN THE HALL HAS PROMISED TO REMAIN SILENCE NO CHOOSE, BOOS OR OTHER INTERRUPTIONS SO WE AND YOU CAN FOCUS ON WHAT THE CANDIDATES HAVE TO SAY. NO NOISE, EXCEPT RIGHT NOW AS WE WELCOME THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE FOR PRESIDENT SECRETARY CLINTON AND THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE FOR PRESIDENT MR. TRUMP. [ Applause ] SECRETARY CLINTON, MR. TRUMP. WELCOME. LET'S GET RIGHT TO IT. THE FIRST TOP SICK THE SUPREME COURT. YOU BOTH TALKED BRIEFLY ABOUT THE COURT IN THE LAST DEBATE BUT I WANT TO DRILL DOWN ON THIS BECAUSE THE NEXT PRESIDENT WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY HAVE AT LEAST ONE APPOINTMENT AND LIKELY OR POSSIBLY TWO OR THREE APPOINTMENTS WHICH MEANS THAT YOU WILL IN EFFECT DETERMINE THE BALANCE OF THE COURT FOR WHAT COULD BE THE NEXT QUARTER CENTURY. FIRST OF ALL, WHERE YOU WANT TO SEE THE COURT TAKE THE COUNTRY AND SECONDLY, WHAT'S YOUR VIEW ON HOW THE CONSTITUTION SHOULD BE INTERPRETED. IS IT JUST WORDS OR IS IT A LIVING DOCUMENT TO BE APPLIED FLEXIBLY ACCORDING TO CHANGING CIRCUMSTANCES, IN THIS SEGMENT, SECRETARY CLINTON YOU GO FIRST, YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES. >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, CHRIS, THANKS TO UNLV FOR HOSTING US. YOU KNOW, I THINK REALLY RACES THE CENTRAL ISSUE IN THIS ELECTION, WHAT KIND OF COUNTRY ARE WE GOING TO BE. WHAT KIND OF OPPORTUNITIES WILL WE PROVIDE FOR OUR CITIZENS, WHAT KIND OF RIGHTS WILL AMERICANS HAVE. AND I FEEL STRONGLY THAT THE SUPREME COURT NEEDS TO STAND ON THE SIDE OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, NOT ON THE SIDE OF THE POWERFUL CORPORATIONS AND THE WEALTHY. FOR ME, THAT MEANS THAT WE NEED A SUPREME COURT THAT WILL STAND UP ON BEHALF OF WOMEN'S RIGHTS, ON BEHALF OF THE RIGHTS OF THE"

I BELIEVE AS MY OPPONENT SHOULD WIN THIS RACE, WHICH DON'T THINK WILL HAPPEN, WE WILL HAVE A 2nd AMENDMENT WHICH WILL BE VERY, VERY SMALL REPLICA OF WHAT IT IS RIGHT NOW. BUT I FEEL THAT IT'S ABSOLUTELY IMPORTANT THAT WE UPHOLD BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT IT IS UNDER SUCH TRAUMA, I FEEL THAT THE JUSTICES THAT I AM GOING TO APPOINT, THAT I NAMED 20 OF THEM, THE JUSTICES THAT I'M GOING TO APPOINT WILL BE PRO RIGHTS, THEY WILL HAVE CONSERVATIVE BENT, THEY WILL BE PROTECTING THE 2nd AMENDMENT, THEY ARE GREAT SCHOLARS IN ALL CASES AND THEY ARE PEOPLE OF TREMENDOUS RESPECT. THEY WILL INTERPRET THE CONSTITUTION THE WAY THE FOUNDERS WANTED IT INTERPRETED. I BELIEVE THAT'S VERY, VERY IMPORTANT. I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD HAVE JUSTICES APPOINTED THAT DECIDE WHAT THEY WANT TO HEAR. IT'S ALL ABOUT THE CONSTITUTION OF -- SO IMPORTANT, THE MEANT TO BE. AND THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT I WILL APPOINT. >> MR. TRUMP, THANK YOU. NOW HAVE ABOUT TEN MINUTES FOR OPEN DISCUSSION, I WANT TO FOCUS ON TWO ISSUES THAT IN FACT BY THE JUSTICES THAT YOU NAMED COEND D UP CHANGING THE EXISTING LAW OF THE LAND. FIRST, IS ONE THAT YOU MENTIONED, MR. TRUMP, THAT IS GUNS. SECRETARY CLINTON YOU SAID LAST YEAR, LET ME QUOTE, THE SUPREME COURT IS WRONG ON THE 2nd AMENDMENT NOW IN FACT IN THE 2 THERE IS A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS, BUT A RIGHT THAT IS REASONABLY LIMITED. THOSE WERE THE WORDS OF THE JUDGE ANTONIN SCALIA, WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT? >> WELL, FIRST OF ALL I SUPPORT THE 2nd AMENDMENT. I LIVED IN ARKANSAS FOR 18 WONDERFUL YEARS, I REPRESENTED"

I REGRET THAT BECAUSE WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE FOR PEOPLE TO COME TOGETHER AND SAY, OF COURSE, WE'RE GOING TO PROTECT AND DEFEND THE 2nd AMENDMENT. BUT WE'RE GOING TO DO IT IN A WAY THAT TRIES TO SAVE SOME OF THESE 43,000 LIVES THAT WE LOSE >> LET ME BRING MR. TRUMP BACK IN, BECAUSE IN FACT, YOU OPPOSED ANY LIMITS ON ASSAULT WEAPONS, ANY LIMITS ON HIGH CAPACITY MAGAZINES, YOU SUPPORT A NATIONAL RIGHT TO CARRY LAW. WHY, SIR? >>  LET ME JUST TELL YOU BEFORE WE GO ANY FURTHER IN CHICAGO, WHICH HAS THE TOUGHEST GUN LAWS IN THE UNITED STATES, PROBABLY YOU COULD SAY BY FAR, THEY HAVE MORE GUN VIOLENCE THAN ANY OTHER CITY. SO, WE HAVE THE TOUGHEST LAWS AND YOU HAVE TREMENDOUS GUN VIOLENCE. I AM A VERY STRONG SUPPORTER OF THE 2nd AMENDMENT, I DON'T KNOW IF HILLARY WAS SAYING IT IN SARCASTIC MANNER BUT I'M PROUD TO HAVE THE ENDORSEMENT OF THE NRA IS EARLIEST ENDORSEMENT IF HE OF THIS EVER GIVEN ANYBODY WHO RAN FOR PRESIDENT. I'M VERY HONORED BY ALL OF THAT. WE ARE GOING TO APPOINT JUSTICES, THIS IS THE BEST WAY TO HELP THE 2nd AMENDMENT, WE ARE GOING TO APPOINT JUSTICES THAT WILL FEEL VERY STRONGLY ABOUT THE 2nd AMENDMENT, THAT WILL NOT DO DAMAGE TO THE 2nd AMOUNTMENT. >> LET'S PICK UP ON ANOTHER ISSUE WHICH DIVIDES YOU. THE JUSTICE, IS THAT WHOEVER ENDS UP WINNING THAT ELECTION COULD HAVE DRAMATIC AFFECT THERE THAT'S THE ISSUE OF ABORTION. MR. TRUMP, YOU'RE PRO LIFE. I WOULDN'T ASK YOU SPECIFICALLY, DO YOU WANT THE COURT, INCLUDING THE JUSTICES THAT YOU WILL NAME, TO OVERTURN ROE V. WADE WHICH INCLUDES, IN FACT STATES, A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO ABORTION. BECAUSE I AM PRO LIFE I WILL BE APPOINTING PRO LIFE JUDGES I WOULD THINK THAT WILL GO BACK TO THE INDIVIDUAL STATES. >> I'M ASKING YOU SPECIFICALLY -- >> IF THEY OVERTURN IT WILL GO BACK TO THE STATES. >> WHAT I'M ASKING YOU, DO YOU WANT TO SEE THE COURT OVERTURN, YOU JUST SAID YOU WANT TO SEE THE COURT PROTECT THE 2nd AMENDMENT, DO YOU WANT TO SEE THE COURT OVERTURN -- >> IF WE PUT ANOTHER TWO OR PERHAPS THREE JUSTICES ON THAT'S REALLY WHAT IS GOING -- THAT'S WHAT WILL HAPPEN. THAT WILL HAPPEN AUTOMATICALLY IN MY OPINION BECAUSE I AM PUTTING PRO LIFE JUSTICES ON THE TO THE STATES AND THE STATES WILL MAKE A DETERMINATION. >> SECRETARY CLINTON? >> I STRONGLY SUPPORT ROE V. WADE WHICH GUARANTEES A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO A WOMAN TO MAKE THE MOST INTIMATE, MOST DIFFICULT IN MANY CASES DECISIONS ABOUT HER HEALTH CARE THAT ONE CAN IMAGINE. AND IN THIS CASE IT'S NOT ONLY ABOUT ROE V. WADE, IT IS ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW IN AMERICA. SO MANY STATES ARE PUTTING VERY STRINGENT REGULATIONS ON WOMEN, BUT BLOCK THEM FROM EXERCISING THAT CHOICE, TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY ARE DEFUNDING PLANNED PARENTHOOD, WHICH OF COURSE PROVIDES ALL KINDS OF CANCER SCREENINGS AND OTHER BENEFITS FOR WOMEN IN OUR COUNTRY.
