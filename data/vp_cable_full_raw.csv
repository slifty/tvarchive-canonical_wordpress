AND WE'VE DONE THE SAME THING ABOUT UKRAINE BUT MORE THAN LAUNCHING PROTESTS WE PUT PUNISHING ECONOMIC SANCTIONS ON RUSSIA THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE. DONALD TRUMP ON THE OTHER HAND DIDN'T KNOW THAT RUSSIA HAD INVADED THE CRIMEA HE WAS ON A TV SHOW COUPLE MONTHS BACK HE SAID I'LL GUARANTEE YOU THIS, RUSSIA NOT GOING INTO THE UKRAINE.

SHE GOT THEM ENGAININGED IN A MEANINGFUL WAY TO CAP IRAN'S NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM. YOU HAVE TO THE ABILITY, HILLARY DOES. ON THE OTHER HAND, IN DONALD TRUMP YOU HAVE SOMEBODY WHO PRAISES VLADIMIR PUTIN ALL THE TIME. AMERICA SHOULD REALLY WONDER ABOUT A PRESIDENT TRUMP WHO HAD A CAMPAIGN MANAGER WITH TIES TO PUTIN, ELEMENTS IN THE UKRAINE HAD TO BE FIRED FOR THAT REASON.

WANT TO SEE US SUPPORTING OUR MILITARY, REBUILDING OUR MILITARY, COMMANDING THE RESPECT OF THE WORLD AND SEE THE AMERICAN ECONOMY OFF TO THE RACES AGAIN. THEY WANT TO SEE AN AMERICAN COME BACK AND DONALD TRUMP'S ENTIRE CAREER HAS BEEN ABOUT BUILDING, IT'S BEEN ABOUT -- GOING THROUGH HARDSHIP JUST LIKE A BUSINESS PERSON DOES, FINDING A WAY THROUGH SMARTS AND INGENERAL KNEW TEE TO FIGHT FORWARD.
