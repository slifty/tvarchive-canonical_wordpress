//The search results template. Used when a search is performed.

// Display a list of posts in excerpt or full-length form. Choose one or the other as appropriate.
// The search results page show the search term which generated the results. It's a simple but useful way to remind someone what they just searched for -- especially in the case of zero results. Use the_search_query() or get_search_query() (display or return the value, respectively).
// It's a good practice to include the search form again on the results page. Include it with: get_search_form().
